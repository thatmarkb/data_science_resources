# Introduction
Following are a couple of groups of links to data science resources that I've found helpful in my own learning and/or continue to reference in the course of my work today. The "Recommended Resources" section is geared toward foundational information/learning and skills development. The "Other Resources" section covers some of this same information, but expands the scope to include career development, blogs for following current events and developments, and well-rated but personally untested curricula.

# Recommended Resources
* For everything, everywhere and all at once, check out the [Awesome Datascience][1] repository
* The [Python Data Science Handbook][2] is available as a Github repository that includes not only the full text but also companion Jupyter notebooks
* Microsoft has a [Data Science for Beginners][3] and [Machine Learning for Beginners][4] repository
* The [Open Source Data Science Masters][5] is a mature and well-maintained repository that covers not only the concepts, tools and techniques of data science but also the math
* The [OSSU Data Science][6] repository is a similar resource covering computer science, data, math, tools, methods and machine learning concepts

# Other Resources
* Jonathan Bower has a great github repository of [Data Science Resources][7] that goes well beyond the foundational knowledge and skills development of the above links. The repo hasn't been updated for a couple of years, but there is a trove of valuable insight into potential career paths, types of work, etc.
*I don't know how current or accurate many of the linked blogs are, but there's no shortage of options in [this list][8].
*I still reference Yu Wu's [Free Data Science Books][9] repository despite it being some time since the last update. Tools, workflows, effort required, etc. change rapidly in the field, but the concepts remain the same and there are very good, specific resources listed there.
*In a similar vein, Tirthajyoti Sarkar has a [Data Science Resources][10] repository that delves into the AI realm as well as specific tools and platforms.
*Finally, there is a [Learn Data Science in 3 Months][11] repository that serves as companion to Siraj Raval's [YouTube Course][12]. I haven't followed this curriculum, but some peers have praised it as a primer and it has quite the following in both places.
